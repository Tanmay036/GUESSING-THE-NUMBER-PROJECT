# GUESSING-THE-NUMBER-PROJECT
 The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based game developed in the C programming  language. The game randomly selects a number within a given range, and the player tries to guess it.  After each guess, the program provides feedback—indicating whether the guessed number is too high,  too low, or correct.

 1. This project demonstrates the use of basic programming concepts such as:
 - Random number generation
 - Loops and conditional statements
 - User input/output
 - Logic implementation and control structures
 The main goal is to improve understanding of fundamental C programming and logical problem-solving 
skills.
