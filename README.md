# GUESSING-THE-NUMBER-PROJECT
 The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based game developed in the C programming  language. The game randomly selects a number within a given range, and the player tries to guess it.  After each guess, the program provides feedback—indicating whether the guessed number is too high,  too low, or correct.
